# How To Install a webextension to Firefox (not signed on)

Firefox does now verify that the add-ons you install have been signed by Mozilla, digitally
([details here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox)).

That's why you have two ways to use unsigned add-ons.

## Install a Webextention as a Temporary Extension

You could simply upload a webextension using **about:debugging** page of Firefox.
   In this case you don't need any special edition of Firefox and special settings to config properties.

## Install a Webextention as a Permanent Extension

1. You need to use on of the special editions of Firefox (you could install it from one of the following links):
- [Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/)
- [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/developer/)
- [Nightly versions of Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/63.0a1/releasenotes/ )
