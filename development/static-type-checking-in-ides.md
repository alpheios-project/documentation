# Static Type Checking

Certain IDEs and editors allow static type checking based on JSDoc information.

Some information on this approach is provided in [Eric Elliott's article](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/you-might-not-need-typescript-or-static-types-aa7cb670a77b).

Here is a summary of static type checking in three major editors/IDEs:
* Atom can support it via [Tern](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ternjs).
* VSCode has a built-in support for type checking. Here is a [TruckJS article](https://medium.com/@trukrs/type-safe-javascript-with-jsdoc-7a2a63209b76) on that.
* IntelliJ IDEA family of IDEs supported it for (quite a long time)[https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2012/10/validating-javascript-code-with-jsdoc-types-annotations/]
